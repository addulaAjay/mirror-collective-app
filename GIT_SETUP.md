# 🚀 Git Repository Setup Guide

## ✅ Current Status

Your local Git repository is set up and ready! You have:
- ✅ Initial commit created with all project files
- ✅ Comprehensive .gitignore files configured
- ✅ No remote repository conflicts

## 🎯 Next Steps: Create GitHub Repository

### Option 1: Create New Repository on GitHub (Recommended)

1. **Go to GitHub** and create a new repository:
   ```
   https://github.com/new
   ```

2. **Repository Settings:**
   - **Repository name:** `mirror-collective-app` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description:** "Cross-platform React Native mobile app with iOS/Android support"
   - **Visibility:** Private or Public (your choice)
   - **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

3. **Connect your local repository:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/ajayaddula/mc_workspace/mirror_collective_app
   
   # Add your new repository as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME and REPO_NAME)
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mirror-collective-app.git
   
   # Push your code to GitHub
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 2: Using SSH (if you prefer SSH over HTTPS)

```bash
# Add remote with SSH
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/mirror-collective-app.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 📋 What's Already Committed

Your repository includes:

```

    ├── 📁 android/            # Android project files
    └── 📄 .gitignore          # App-level ignore rules
```

## 🔒 Security Notes

The .gitignore files are configured to exclude:
- ✅ **Environment variables** (.env files)
- ✅ **Signing keys** (*.keystore, *.p12, *.mobileprovision)
- ✅ **IDE settings** (except VS Code tasks/launch configs)
- ✅ **Build artifacts** (build/, node_modules/)
- ✅ **Local configuration** (local.properties, etc.)
- ✅ **Cache files** (Metro, Gradle, npm caches)

## 🚀 After Setting Up GitHub

Once you've created and connected your GitHub repository:

1. **Verify the connection:**
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   # Should show your GitHub repository URL
   ```

2. **Future commits:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   git push
   ```

3. **Share with team members:**
   ```bash
   # They can clone with:
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mirror-collective-app.git
   cd mirror-collective-app
   ./setup.sh
   ```

## 🎯 Team Collaboration Setup

For team development, consider:

1. **Branch Protection Rules** (in GitHub repository settings)
2. **Pull Request Templates**
3. **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD
4. **Code Review Requirements**

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Permission denied (publickey)"
**Solution:** Set up SSH keys or use HTTPS instead
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
```

### Issue: "Repository not found"
**Solution:** Double-check the repository name and your access rights

### Issue: "Updates were rejected"
**Solution:** This shouldn't happen with a new repository, but if it does:
```bash
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

## 🎉 Ready to Push!

Your React Native project is now ready to be shared with the world. Once you create the GitHub repository and push your code, your team members can:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `./setup.sh` for automated setup
3. Start developing immediately with `./start-metro.sh`

**Happy coding! 🚀**
